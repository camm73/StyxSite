# Styx Github Pages Website

This is the GitHub Pages source code for the Styx website. Styx was an early stage startup that I was working on during my freshman year of college that was developing a smart vaporizor pen that allowed for personalized quitting regiments for ending nicotine addiction by weaning the user off of nicotine according to symptom feedback provided by the user in the (Styx App)[https://github.com/camm73/Styx].

Unfortunately this project was ended due to an extremely similar product being in development and prepared for release in 2019 by JUUL, a multi-billion dollar company with whom we could not effectively compete. Details about JUUL's product can be found (here) [https://www.ft.com/content/07eb3e20-72bf-11e9-bbfb-5c68069fbd15].


The Styx website is still live until the domain expires and can be found (here) [styxhealth.com]
