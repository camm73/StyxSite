# Styx Github Pages Website

This is the GitHub Pages source code for the Styx website. Styx was an early stage startup that I was working on during my freshman year of college that was developing a smart vaporizor pen that allowed for personalized quitting regiments for ending nicotine addiction by weaning the user off of nicotine according to symptom feedback provided by the user in the [Styx App](https://github.com/camm73/Styx).

Unfortunately this project was ended due to an extremely similar product being in development and prepared for release in 2019 by JUUL, a multi-billion dollar company with whom we could not effectively compete. Details about JUUL's product can be found [here](https://www.ft.com/content/07eb3e20-72bf-11e9-bbfb-5c68069fbd15).


The Styx website is still live until the domain expires and can be found [here](https://styxhealth.com).
